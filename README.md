# LaTeX Template for Books

This repo contains a generic template for books, thesis, handouts etc.

There is a *book.tex* **the file to compile** and *set.tex* for the settings of some packages (like listings, captions and so forth).

The file compile well without any errors or warnings. As always is preferable to have installed a full TeX distributions in order to avoid problems.

Versions:

* 0.1 --- Created file with listings and caption packages (and their customizations in set.tex)that allow users to add code and captions. The file is able to house .bib archive (which is upcoming).
